# Prototyped DataSHIELD Scatter Plot Function
---------
The following functions are prototypes for a privacy preserving scatter plot function in [DataSHIELD](https://github.com/datashield) based on the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm. 

`QA.ds.ScatterPlot`

`centroids1dDS.b.R`

`centroids2dDS.b.R`

# Test R script
The script `ds.ScatterPlot.b.R` can run outside of DataSHIELD in R.  It produces a simulated dataset and creates a scatter plot utilising the same approach as the pair of DataSHIELD client-server functions.
